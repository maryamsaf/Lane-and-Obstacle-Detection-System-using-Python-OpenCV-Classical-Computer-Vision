# Lane and Obstacle Detection System — Python, OpenCV, Classical Computer Vision

A real-time classical computer vision system for lane and obstacle detection using OpenCV and Python.  
It uses ROI masking, Canny + Hough line fitting, and inverse thresholding" for obstacle detection, displaying an on-screen "HUD" with FPS, lane-fit accuracy (R²), lane stability, and STOP/MOVE logic — all "without deep learning".
